This directory contains compatibility headers necessary to compile GLOW
under the SGI IRIX MIPSPro 7.3 development environment. This directory
should be installed somewhere reasonable such as /usr/lib, and you will
need to include it in a -I directive to your compiler in order to get
GLOW to compile under MIPSPro. Alternately, you may install the headers
directly into /usr/include/CC, but do not replace any headers already
there!
