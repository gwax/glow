<p>
You should start by reading through lesson 0, which will give you an idea of how to write and compile a GLOW-based program. You should make sure you can successfully build the testglow program given with lesson 0.
</p>
<p>
You may be able to glean a lot of information from looking at the source code to testglow, enough, perhaps, to get started writing your own GLOW programs. I suggest at least skimming through lessons 1 through 5, however, to make sure you have a grasp of the major concepts in GLOW. Each lesson is fairly short and shouldn't take more than fifteen to thirty minutes to read through, and they contain tips on how to interact with GLOW and avoid pitfalls.
</p>
<p>
The remaining lessons may not be strictly necessary for you. Lesson 6 deals with integrating GLOW and GLUT code, which is primarily useful if you just want to write a program based on the GLUT API but you want to add widgets to it. The remaining lessons deal with advanced topics. You can read them later as you get more comfortable using GLOW and want to take advantage of some of its advanced features.

<p>
Next, I suggest skipping to lesson 6, which deals with integrating GLUT and GLOW code. You should be able to get a good idea of how to add widgets to a GLOW program from looking at the sample program described in that lesson. You can then go back and glance over some of the previous lessons to flesh out your knowledge. The most important ones are lesson 4, which deals with widgets and the QuickPalette interface, and lesson 3, which describes the mechanism by which you respond to widget events.
